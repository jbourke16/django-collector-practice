## Labs for Cat Collector Lessons
In this unit, the goal of each Django lab will be to repeat everything we've done in the lesson -- except you'll "collect" something new (like Finches) and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever you are collecting ðŸ˜€

The final version of your "______ Collector" will be a deliverable.

Because your completed Collector project will be fairly comprehensive, makes it a great candidate for an addition to your portfolio.

Be sure to create your project and push it to a repo in your **personal GitHub account**.

## Submission 
- Submit **one issue ticket** with the **link to your personal github repo** and add any questions or comments you have for instructors.
- Make a **commit after each part** with a commit message noting which part is complete.
- Once ALL parts are complete, **make a final commit noting that the project is complete**.
